### About
I am a front end web developer with a background in customer service. My passions lie in crafts and visual arts. I pull everything I've learned from my time in retail to my history as a photographer in order to build a growing database of experiences. I then use these experiences to connect with my community and create unique, one-of-a-kind projects that capture the personalities of my clients.
